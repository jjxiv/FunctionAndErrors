# FunctionAndErrors
The project consists of utilizing proper error handling in solidity programming.

## Description

The project's purpose is to demonstrate the knowledge of the student from Metacrafters, properly show how the program works, and most of all, to test the student's skill. In order to demonstrate the student's knowledge, I was tasked to demonstrate how to use proper error handling in solidity programming. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., FunctionAndErrorProj.sol) or copy and paste the FunctionAndErrorProj.sol source code into the Remix IDE.


### Executing program

* Compile the program by pressing (ctrl + s) or click the compile button from the left pane.
* Deploy the smart contract from the left pane and test the values for minting and burning a token.
